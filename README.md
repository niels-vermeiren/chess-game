# Chess Game

As with so many people, the series 'The Queen's gambit' peeked my interest in chess. In order to understand
the game at a deeper level, I decided to create my own Chess game. I also wanted to learn how to code in Qt and C++, 
and potentially to develop a simple chess A.I. 

## Features

- Capturing
- Check and checkmate algorithms
- Can't set yourself in check 
- Castling
